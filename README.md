# musixbot

Musixmatch bot for Facebook Messenger.

This server-side code implements the functionality of a
[Messenger](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform) bot that, on receiving a message with a part
of song lyrics, searches for them in the [Musixmatch API](https://developer.musixmatch.com/), and delivers the
top results.
